This is my pre-liminary project for SSP in NAIST (Japan). This is a tool detection project using YOLOv7 backbone where the YOLOv7 creators uses PyTorch (torch) as their YOLOv7 framework. 

This repo only contains a notebook file as shown above, you can open it by using Colab, vscode, or Jupyter. Please open the notebook and read the first markdown part. There, you can navigate the necessary files such as weights and data.yaml as Github does not allow uploading files with size more than 25MB (Weigths file contains around ~75MB).
